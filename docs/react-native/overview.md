# React Native

Anhanga integration for React Native using the `@anhanga/react` package with Expo.

::: warning Coming Soon
Full documentation for the React Native integration is under construction. The API is the same as the [React integration](/react/use-data-form), with platform-specific renderers.
:::

## Playground

The React Native playground demonstrates the full stack using Expo:

```
playground/react-native/
  src/presentation/
    components/renderers/   ← field renderer components (React Native)
    contracts/component.ts  ← ComponentContract (expo-router)
    components/DataForm.tsx
```

## Quick Start

```bash
pnpm --filter @anhanga/playground start
```
